The following locations are obsolete; fetch them from one of
the master repositories.

The following is the status and description of every ref in
every repository.  (Note that "item" is my private copy.)
Where I mark "x", you should be able to get it there.
Where I mark "?", you should not be able to get it there.
Where I mark nothing, it means they are (to my knowledge) gone.

Regarding the LETTER FORMAT, the following headers have been in use
since Pull Request #1.  All dates are standardized in RFC 2822 format,
with precision in integral seconds, and in parentheticals, the value
in their original forms is stored.  The schema of canonical URIs is
normalized by removing the "s" for "secure" from SSL/TLS protocols
(e.g. ftps, https).  Long lines are visually broken up per RFC 8792.
Everything is in UTF-8 with lines delimited by the Unix line feed
(LF, 0x0a, \012), except possibly the payload (see Content-Type)
unless stated otherwise.

    Submitted-At
       Date at which the Webhook was delivered.
       (This value is originally given as Unix epoch.)
    Created-At
       The string attribute: .pull_request.created_at
       (This value is originally given as Unix epoch.)
    Updated-At
       The string attribute: .pull_request.updated_at
    Base-Uri,Head-Uri
       The string attribute: .pull_request.{base,head}.repo.clone_url.
         (The URI is canonicalized according to the rule above.)
    Base-Ref,Head-Ref
       The string attribute: .pull_request.base.ref, prepended with "refs/heads/".
    Base-Oid,Head-Oid
       The string attribute: .pull_request.base.sha
    Subject
       The string attribute: .pull_request.title
    Content-Type
       Header borrowed from RFC 2046.  This will continue be the constant
       'text/markdown; charset="UTF-8"', as long as GitHub continues to use
       GitHub-flavored Markdown for their pull requests.

       [[[ Aside: ... which is the same reason why I stay the fuck away
           from it -- the fact that it assumes EVERYTHING is marked up,
           and compliant with their little Markdown language.  Something
           as fundamental as unified-diff PATCHES is rendered completely
           useless under their ostentatious Markdown processor:

           <https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/530#issuecomment-247430269>

           Read, for example the (opinionated) take:

           <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5661185>

           I think GitHub should at least respect the Content-Type header
           of the email it receives from a Pull Request / Issue comment
           instead of just assuming it is all markdown.
        ]]]

        text/markdown is the accepted Internet media type (MIME type) of
        John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swarz)'s Markdown since RFC 7763.
       (I guess Gruber wouldn't be happy if I credited Aaron as the "co-creator",
        well... (Want to learn about the whole ordeal about the Markdown
        trademark history?  Me neither!  But here's that for reference
        anyways.

         <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/#acknowledgements>   (excerpt:
            Aaron Swartz [1] deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his
            feedback on the design of Markdown’s formatting syntax. Markdown is
            much better thanks to Aaron’s ideas, feedback, and testing. Also,
            Aaron’s html2text is a very handy (and free) utility for turning
            HTML into Markdown-formatted plain text.

             @adders A niggle: I am Markdown’s sole creator, not co-creator. I assume,
             you’re thinking of Aaron Swartz, whose feedback was instrumental…
           )
         <https://crossword.fm/s09/e13/>  (excerpt:
            Luke:
            But I’m curious about the genesis, you know, like, is this like a,
            is this like a weekend project that you’re like, “wouldn’t it be
            cool if…”, or is it a long term?
            
            John:
            No, well, hmm.
            
            So basically the timeline - and, again, I don’t want to be a
            downer, and there’s this whole sort of sidetrack thing where it’s
            like, that actually Aaron [Swartz] was the co-creator of Markdown,
            which is not true. But he was the one beta tester of Markdown who
            got it right from the start and was the one who gave me the best
            and most feedback. He was effectively, you know, boiled down to me
            making it, thinking I’ve got something here. And Aaron being the
            beta tester who was like, “Yeah, you’ve got something here. Keep
            going. You know, you’re almost done.”
         )

         In 2014 people tried to standardize Markdown as it had made its
         way into many, MANY platforms -- from GitHub to Reddit and all.
         That's basically the story of CommonMark <https://commonmark.org/>.
          ... except it didn't start there.
         (I am not going to quote these; this is going to take me ages....)

       )
    Content-Length
       Header borrowed from RFC 2046.
    Content-Digest
       Header borrowed from RFC 9530, which notably obsoletes the Digest header
       in RFC 3230, and diverges in that the digest is now embraced with colons.
       An example of this is the pull request message at bip/club-radar:

     sha=:uKP/7ePQii2k5k4dTtxODwGuSOk=:,\
     sha-256=:tKbD5V5DOLYZ/eKu8Ceh38lmsoBEGewrQY0QgRR/3wg=:,\
     sha-384=:5IlwLaRsIVVKIxcuucteqSkIBZD4RVDHQDG4AajDvlLKyfZSNcqsvxysgAxckBWS:,\
     sha-512=:eCJ+ZgS433Ih1dCAfXRklyQusIxEHa4OwcpOgBBiUmLe/FIbcqTTCuhObwPZ51LwFzbvac/f6qbgk3E+UsJ2wA==:

     These can be generated running:

         git notes --ref=letters show bip/club-radar |
         perl -012 -ne 'print unless 1 .. /^$/' |
         openssl dgst <METHOD> -binary | base64

     where <METHOD> is replaced with:

         -sha1       for sha
         -sha256     for sha-256
         -sha384     for sha-384
         -sha512     for sha-512

The payload is the string attribute: .pull_request.body.

As for the commit object itself, the author date should be consistent
with the date of submission with the time zone offset *EXPRESSLY* set
to -0000 according to the RFC 2822 convention of region-independent
time representation.  The author identifier should *ALWAYS* be
    GitHub <noreply@github.com>
for GitHub Webhook-triggered edits.

You may have observed that the GitHub pull request URL and mailing list
Message-ID are starkly missing.  This is because (1) pull requests in this
model are merely proposals that are not specifically tied to any URI/URL
(2) I don't need it as they live in my own refs/pulls/* namespace anyways :)

The goal is to make this Git notes (which is a blob) as canonicalized
as possible.  Pull request numbers are finicky as those are IDs not
managed by me; and neither are Message-IDs since, even though I am super
smart and very mindful about my generation of Message-IDs under my two
namespaces "e.rapidcow.org" and "x.rapidcow.org", most people are not.
And I am not going to put up with some <SJ0PR06MB716154E75B1B98ED77DC672AFD03A@SJ0PR06MB7161.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>
if people aren't even going to see them most of the time.  Anyways,
they are kept separately in refs/notes/amlog so I could update them
independently (also because that is what Junio, the revered Git
maintainer, uses to maintain references to the original email from
which the patch was submitted.)

The headers in the sync/edit branch follows a similar format
(in particular, the Submitted-At header is essentially identical
to this one) but I'm not formally documenting it this time since
it is for personal bookkeeping anyways rather than a complete
backup. :)
