# We are not a Git worktree, so this isn't intended
# for git to read -- instead, this informs store-meta
# what NOT to include in its snapshot report. :)
#
# Be careful that a directory exclude is a bit nuclear
# at the moment, being effectively a --path --prune.
#
# A directory exclude must also be explicitly stated
# as such (e.g., "annex/" and not "annex" alone.)
# If you want to include both a file and a directory,
# you must write the same name twice -- once with "/"
# and once without.
#
# A leading slash pins the path to the root directory.
#
# For Git repositories turned non-bare, a second copy
# of the tree might be nice; but if you prefer to leave
# out the index (or cache, as it used to be called):
#/index
#
# For Git-annex repositories, you might want this:
#/annex/
#
# If you want to index Git objects within itself,
# you can reverse the ignore rule very much like
# you would with the real gitignore file (though be
# warned that info/refs and packed-refs are still
# filtered unless you override --blob-filter).
#!/objects/
