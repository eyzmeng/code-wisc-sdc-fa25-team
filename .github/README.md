# [Insert Project Name]

We are down to our **finalists**!

* [Club radar](https://rapidcow.github.io/site-wisc-sdc-fa25-team/ideas/club-radar) [3 votes]
* [Task manager](https://rapidcow.github.io/site-wisc-sdc-fa25-team/ideas/task-manager) [2 votes]
* [Minecraft with Computer Vision](https://rapidcow.github.io/site-wisc-sdc-fa25-team/ideas/minecraft-cv) [2 votes]

I will be adding some base code for each finalist
in a BIP (Branch of Interest-worthy Project):

* [bip/task-manager](https://github.com/SDC-Fall-2025/Team-17-Project/tree/bip/task-manager)
  (tentative stack: Kotlin with SQLite, develop in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio))

We will probably meet sometime this week, so hopefully
by then we can go with a project and get started for real.
